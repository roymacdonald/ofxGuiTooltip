# ofxGuiTooltip

This addon allows you to add tooltips to openFrameworks' ofxGui


There are two examples:

* **example-json**: Shows how to load tooltips from a json file. This is the preferred and easiest way to add tooltips to the gui.

* **example-inline**: Shows how to add tooltips directly in the code without needing to use a json file. This method can get quite cumbersome really fast.
